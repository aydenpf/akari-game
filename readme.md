<h1>Akari Minigame</h1>

<h4>Description </h4>
<p>Welcome to Ayden Franklin's akari game simulator made with Java and JavaFX. Akari is a simple puzzle game, featuring cells which contain walls, lamps, or empty corridors. The goal is to light every corridor up, but there are restrictions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lights shine every corridor vertically and horizontally until a wall or boundary is reached</li>
  <li>Numbers in some wall cells denote the number of lights to be placed in adjacent cells</li>
  <li>Lights cannot be placed in line vertically or horizontally with one another</li>
</ul>
<p>This project implemented the model view controller design pattern and served as a learning tool for object oriented programming.</p>
